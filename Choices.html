   <p>The sound of muted moans and scratching can be heard outside the door. You've been locked in this apartment for a few days now, <b>terrified by what's happening outside.</b></p>
   <p><b>It started as an ordinary day in the city.</b> You were just a simple person, but just a few weeks ago, <b>everything changed.</b></p>
   <p>A deadly epidemic spread, turning people into flesh-hungry cratures, <b>zombies.</b></p>
   <p><b>Your building has become your last refuge.</b></p> 
   <p>You barricaded the entrance with everything you could find. Supplies are running low, and the situation is becoming unbearable.</p>
   <p>The constant creaking of zombies outside indicates that <b>they know you're there.</b></p>
